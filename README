DESCRIPTION
    WARNING: Codebase is alpha with extreme prejudice. Assume that bugs are
    teeming and that the API is subject to change.

    Template::Caribou is a Moose-based, class-centric templating system
    mostly aimed at producing sgml-like outputs, mostly HTML, but also XML,
    SVG, etc. It is heavily inspired by Template::Declare.

    For a manual on how to use "Template::Caribou", have a peek at
    Template::Caribou::Manual.

METHODS
  pretty_render()
    Returns true if rendered templates are passed through the prettifier.

  enable_pretty_render( $bool )
    if set to true, rendered templates will be filtered by a prettifier
    before being returned by the "render()" method.

  import_template_dir( $directory )
    Imports all the files with a ".bou" extension in *$directory* as
    templates (non-recursively).

    Returns the name of the imported templates.

  show( $template, @args )
    Outside of a template, behaves like "render()". In a template, prints
    out the result of the rendering in addition of returning it.
